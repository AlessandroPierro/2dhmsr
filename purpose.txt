The purpose of this branch is to allow for customizable/extendible components that draw information from and during the simulation.

I plan to do two things:
a) deeply refactor the Immutable/Snapshot parts: every entity, both situated (e.g., a voxel)
 and not situated (e.g., a sensor reading) has to possibly be able to provide info
b) deeply refactor the Drawer parts: every info could be drawn

a is done with some additional cleaning.
b has to be done: one way to do that is to abstract a general Drawer interface that receive a time,
 the list of snapshots (or the lineage, or the lineage with elements decorated with the sibling or sibling-of-type
 index), the graphicFrame and an indication on whether to clip/rescale the graphicFrame to a world coordinates, and draws.
 That made, GraphicDrawer can be generalized.

done in a way similar to b. now going to clean

Update of 2/9/2021 18:40
Cleaning done. Still to do:
a better InfoDrawer (with robot centers)
b nicer Framer interface (with windows t and num of robots to monitor)
c controllers as snapshottable
d example of drawers for controllers

Update of 3/9/2021 12.34
Most done. Still c and d missing.
